This is a set of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) for English-speaking users of
TeX. The information is maintained by a [group of
"curators"](https://github.com/texfaq), with contributions from a very wide
range of people over many years.

The questions answered here cover a wide range of topics, but typesetting
issues are mostly covered from the viewpoint of a LaTeX user.

It's easier to add information than it is to decide that information is no
longer needed: questions are therefore not deleted but are "retired" (removed
from the main index) over time.

## Referencing the FAQ

The preferred URL for the FAQ is  
<https://texfaq.org>

The previous canonical URL of  
`http://www.tex.ac.uk`  
no longer works and should not be used.

To reference a specific question the preferred form is  
<https://texfaq.org/FAQ-LaTeX3>  
with FAQ in upper case and the question ID as given on the relevant page.

There are no redirects enabled on the hosting site, however if your client
supports JavaScript and HTML redirects then other forms differing by case
will also work such as  
<http://texfaq.org/faq-latex3>  
For compatibility with exiting references to the FAQ, the form  
<http://www.texfaq.org/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=LaTeX3>  
may also be used, to ease in conversion from the previous URL  
`http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=LaTeX3`  
but this again relies on the client supporting
JavaScript in the new hosting arrangement and is just intended to
support existing references that link to the site.
