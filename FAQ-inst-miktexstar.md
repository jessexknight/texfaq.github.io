Packages for use with MiKTeX are maintained very efficiently by the
project managers (new packages and updates on CTAN ordinarily
make their way to the MiKTeX package repository within a week).
Thus it makes sense for the MiKTeX user to take advantage of the
system rather than grinding through the steps of installation.

MiKTeX maintains a database of packages it "knows about",
together with (coded) installation instructions that enable it to
install the packages with minimal user intervention; you can update
the database over the internet.

If MiKTeX does know about a package you need installed, it's worth
using the system:
first, open the MiKTeX packages window: click on
  `Start`&rarr;
  `Programs`&rarr;
  `MiKTeX`&rarr;
  `MiKTeX Options`, and select the
  `Packages` tab.

On the tab, there is an Explorer-style display of packages.
Right-click on the root of the tree, `MiKTeX Packages`,
and select `Search`: enter the name of the package you're
interested in, and press the `Search` button.  If
MiKTeX knows about your package, it will open up the tree to show
you a tick box for your package: check that box.

If you prefer a command-line utility, open a
command shell, and type:
```
miktex packages install <package>
```

(which of course assumes you know the name by which MiKTeX refers to
your package).
