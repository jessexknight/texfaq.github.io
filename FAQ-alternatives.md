The idea of using a programmatic approach to typeset documents is not limited
to TeX, and there have been many different approaches explored over the years.
Some of these seek to potentially replace TeX, others are more complementary.
The use of (La)TeX-like syntax is seen in some, though not all, of these.

The projects listed here are entirely distinct from TeX or its derivatives
(they are not "TeX-like" programs).

## Active projects

### Typst
[Typst](https://typst.app/) is a typesetting system written in Rust. It uses a
markdown-like input syntax and includes an interpreted scripting language. Typst
focuses on being easy to learn and create templates for and features fast
compile times.

### Patoline

[Patoline](https://patoline.github.io/) is a typesetting system written in OCaml and
using a mix of TeX-like syntax and "escape" to OCaml to provide typesetting
control. Patoline aims for a module design, and fast numerical processing.

### SILE

[SILE](https://sile-typesetter.org/) is a typesetting system written in Lua and
using the HarfBuzz font shaper. It's input syntax is somewhat inspired by
LaTeX, for example
```latex
\begin{document}
Hello SILE!
\end{document}
```
is a valid SILE document (notice the _lack_ of a preamble here).

### Speedata Publisher

[Speedata Publisher](https://www.speedata.de/en/) is like SILE written in Lua,
but uses LuaTeX (not pure Lua) to provide the "back-end". This means it does
feature a _tiny_ TeX-based wrapper, but once that has handed over to Lua, TeX
is not involved. Speedata Publisher is particularly well-suited to some areas
in which TeX is less successful, for example more image-rich documents.

### Lout

[Lout](https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lout/) is a batch document
formatter invented by Jeffrey H. Kingston. It reads a high-level
description of a document similar in style to LaTeX Lout copies some
of its formatting algorithms from TeX but uses a high-level functional
programming language, instead of a macro language as its customisation
language. Lout has never had the user base of LaTeX, but is still maintained
and was released around the same time as LaTeX2e in the early 1990's.


### troff/nroff/groff

[groff](https://www.gnu.org/software/groff/) The \*roff family of typesetters
pre-date TeX and influenced its design. They have always been distributed as part
of Unix and Unix-like systems such as linux. Most notably **man** pages are typeset
with this system.

## Historical projects

### The ANT typesetting system

Achim Blumensath's ANT project aimed not to replicate TeX with a different
implementation technique, but rather to provide a replacement for TeX which
uses TeX-like typesetting algorithms in a very different programming
environment. ANT's markup language was modelled on (La)TeX, but implemented in
OCaml.
